# Gender, Age & Emotion Detection Using Pre-trained Deep Learning Models

This project performs **face detection** and uses **pre-trained deep learning models** to predict **gender**, **age**, and **emotion** from facial images. It demonstrates a simple pipeline for analyzing facial attributes.

---

## 🧠 Features

- Detects faces in images
- Predicts **gender** (male/female)
- Estimates **age range**
- Recognizes **emotion** (happy, sad, neutral)
- Uses **pre-trained CNN models**

## 🚀 Setup & Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SahanashreeTalagade/Gender-Age-Emotion-Detection-Using-Pre-trained-Deep-Learning-Models.git
cd Gender-Age-Emotion-Detection-Using-Pre-trained-Deep-Learning-Models
````

---

## 🛠 Dependencies

Install required Python libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Dependencies include:

* `opencv-python`
* `numpy`
* `tensorflow`
* `keras`
* `pillow`
* `matplotlib` (optional)

---

## 💡 Usage

1. Put your test images in `test_image/`.
2. Run the main script:

```bash
python src/main.py
```

3. The script will detect faces and output:

* **Gender**
* **Age estimate**
* **Emotion**

4. Results will be displayed on images with bounding boxes or printed in the console.

---

## 🤖 How It Works

1. **Face Detection:** Uses Haar Cascade to locate faces.
2. **Attribute Prediction:** Pre-trained CNN models classify gender, predict age, and recognize emotion.
3. **Output:** Results are displayed on images with bounding boxes and labels.

---

## 🧪 Sample Images

The `test_image/` folder contains example images to test the pipeline.

✅ This structure is **fully Markdown-compliant** for GitHub.  

If you want, I can **also add badges at the top** (Python version, license, stars) and a **table of contents** so your repo looks professional for recruiters.  

Do you want me to do that?
