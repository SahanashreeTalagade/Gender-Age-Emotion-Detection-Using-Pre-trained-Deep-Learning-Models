# Gender-Age-Emotion-Detection-Using-Pre-trained-Deep-Learning-Models
This project performs **face detection** and uses **pre-trained deep learning models** to predict **gender**, **age**, and **emotion** from facial images. It provides a simple pipeline that demonstrates how deep learning and computer vision can analyze facial attributes in static images.

---

##  Features

- Detects faces in images
- Predicts **gender** (e.g., male/female)
- Estimates **age range**
- Recognizes **emotion** (e.g., happy, sad, neutral)
- Uses **pre-trained CNN models** for inference
